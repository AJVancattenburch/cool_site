STARTING
In your command line create your files.

mkdir to create the directory for your project.

cd PROJECTNAME into the project you just created.

touch to create the files within your project. It will include an index.html and a style.css.

Assets: If you want to include the actual assets from this project you may do so but you can also feel free to branch out and pick your own unique flare of images and colors.


BUILDING
Use Flexbox for the layout
Focus on the html structure
Don't worry about matching the colors perfectly
Use VScode's lorem generator or go look up some fun other ones.
⚠️ Make sure that your files are linked together!
